# horiseon-site-hw
This is the 1's homework assignment for boot camp wk.1

--My screen is 1440p, so appologies if it looks different on lower resolutions. I did my best to accomodate for the size/space of the site without certain flex objects.

## Changes/Change log

(Big picture)

-- Consolodated CSS by about 70 lines, not counting the added notes.
-- Shrunk the HTML, getting rid of needless <div> sections, and instead wrapping them in the given element of <header>, <section> and <aside>
-- Grouped together identifiers into a single Class in html, to make them easier to group in the CSS

##Issues
--<nav> links work, but will not line up next to each other dispite making them inline. a ::margin shows next to them on devtools, Not sure why and having difficulty finding a solution without spending too much time on it.

-- Aside bar was having difficulty aligning to the right, even with the "float:right" so I applied an absolute position on it. It looks fine on my computer, but I can see it being an issue on something smaller like a laptop. Would fix if I had more time.
